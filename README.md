# Purpose of project

The purpose of this project was to design a file transfer protocol (FTP) platform that would allow college professors to upload any document to a website. Additionally, the platform would allow students to download files only if they were connected to the college network. The platform was designed to provide a secure and reliable means of sharing documents between professors and students within the college environment.
